The Threat Detection section in Ace Shield allows you to proactively identify and respond to potential threats and vulnerabilities in your environment. It provides valuable insights into both MITRE ATT&CK framework-based attacks and vulnerabilities. 

**MITRE ATT&CK®**

The MITRE ATT&CK® framework is a comprehensive repository that categorizes and describes various tactics and techniques used by adversaries during cyberattacks. Ace Shield offers three widgets to help you monitor and analyze MITRE ATT&CK® related information. 

**Top Tactics** 

The Top Tactics widget highlights the most impactful tactics and defense evasion techniques observed in your environment. It provides an overview of the tactics that threat actors commonly employ and helping you to focus your security efforts accordingly. By understanding the tactics and defense evasion techniques, you can proactively strengthen your defenses and mitigate potential risks. 

 

**MITRE ATT&CK® and Events**

 

The "MITRE ATT&CK® and Events" widget presents a bar graph that depicts the count of MITRE ATT&CK® related events over a specified date/time range. This visual representation enables you to identify patterns, spikes, or trends in MITRE ATT&CK® events, helping you understand the frequency and nature of attacks. By analyzing this data, you can identify areas of vulnerability and take appropriate measures to fortify your defenses. 

 

**Detailed View of MITRE ATT&CK® Events**

The "Detailed View of MITRE ATT&CK® Events" widget provides a comprehensive and granular view of individual MITRE ATT&CK® events. It displays various attributes associated with each event, including the timestamp, agent ID, agent name, rule description, rule ID, and other relevant fields. This detailed view allows security analysts to investigate specific events, gather crucial details, and initiate appropriate response actions. 

 

**Vulnerability**

The Vulnerability section in Ace Shield focuses on identifying and managing vulnerabilities within your environment. 

###Severity 

The Severity widget provides an overview of the severity levels associated with the identified vulnerabilities. It visually represents the distribution of vulnerabilities across different severity categories, such as Critical, High, Medium, and Low. This widget allows you to quickly assess the overall risk landscape and prioritize your remediation efforts based on the severity of vulnerabilities. 

###Summary 

The Summary widget offers a concise summary of the vulnerabilities detected in your system. It provides an overview of the total number of vulnerabilities and highlights the most critical ones. This widget enables you to get a quick snapshot of the current vulnerability status and identify any immediate actions that may be required. 

###Vulnerability Events 

The Vulnerability Events widget displays a graph illustrating the count of vulnerabilities over time. It shows the relationship between the date/time and the number of vulnerability events detected. This widget allows you to track the occurrence of vulnerabilities over time, helping you identify patterns, trends, or specific periods of heightened vulnerability activity that require further investigation. 

###Detailed View of Vulnerability Events 

The Detailed View of Vulnerability Events widget displays a list of recent vulnerability events. It provides a chronological view of when vulnerabilities were detected, along with relevant information such as the timestamp, agent ID, agent name, and rule ID. This widget allows you to track the occurrence of vulnerabilities over time, helping you identify patterns, trends, or specific areas of concern that require further investigation.
