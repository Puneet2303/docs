The Feeds feature in Ace Shield is designed to enhance your security monitoring capabilities by incorporating external data sources that provide valuable information about security threats, vulnerabilities, and indicators of compromise. This section of the user manual will guide you through the process of managing and utilizing feeds within Ace Shield. 

 

**Understanding Feeds**

Feeds are curated data sources that contain vital information related to known malicious IP addresses, domain names, URLs, malware signatures, and other indicators of compromise. These feeds are typically maintained by security vendors, organizations, or open-source communities. By enabling feeds into your account, you can proactively identify potential security incidents and detect abnormal behavior within your network. 

  

**Managing Feeds**

In the Feeds section of Ace Shield, you can view and manage the feeds that are currently integrated into the system. Each feed entry includes the following details: 


| Feed Name              | Description                                                                                         |
