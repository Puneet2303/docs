The Monitoring section in Ace Shield provides comprehensive visibility into various aspects of your system, including policy adherence, integrity monitoring, CIS-CAT compliance, and Security Configuration Assessment (SCA). 

**Policy Monitoring**

The Policy Monitoring allows you to monitor and enforce compliance with predefined security policies within your environment. It offers three widgets to aid in policy monitoring. 

**Rule Distribution**

The "Rule Distribution" widget provides an overview of the distribution of policy rules across your systems. It helps you understand how rules are being applied and identify any potential gaps or inconsistencies in policy enforcement. 

 

**Policy Monitoring Events**

The "Policy Monitoring Events" widget presents a bar graph that illustrates the count of policy monitoring events over a specified date/time range. This visual representation allows you to observe patterns and trends in policy violations, enabling you to address non-compliant activities promptly. 

 

**Detailed View of Policy Monitoring Events**

The "Detailed View of Policy Monitoring Events" widget offers a detailed perspective on individual policy monitoring events. It displays attributes such as timestamp, agent ID, agent name, rule description, rule ID, and other relevant fields. This detailed view allows security analysts to investigate specific policy violations, gather additional information, and initiate appropriate actions for remediation. 

 

**Integrity Monitoring**

The Integrity Monitoring subpart focuses on detecting and monitoring changes to critical files and system integrity. It provides valuable insights into potential unauthorized modifications or security breaches. Here are the eight widgets available under the Integrity Monitoring subpart: 

  

**Integrity Monitoring Events**

Presents a visual representation of the count of integrity monitoring events over time, allowing you to identify trends and spikes in activity. 

  

**Files Modified**

Provides information about files that have been modified within your systems, helping you track changes and identify potentially malicious or unauthorized alterations. 

  

**Most Active Users**

Highlights the users who have performed the most file modifications, aiding in identifying user behaviour and potential security risks. 

  

**Actions**

Presents a breakdown of the actions performed during integrity monitoring events, such as file modifications, deletions, or additions, providing insights into the nature of the changes. 

  

**Files Deleted**

Displays information about files that have been deleted, allowing you to identify potentially suspicious or unauthorized deletions. 

  

**Files Added**

Provides details about files that have been added to your systems, aiding in identifying new or potentially malicious files. 

 

**Integrity Monitoring Events**

Offers a comprehensive view of integrity monitoring events, enabling you to explore event details such as timestamps, rule IDs, agent IDs, agent names, and more. 

  

**Detailed Integrity Monitoring Events**

Provides a more granular and comprehensive view of individual integrity monitoring events, including specific attributes such as timestamps, rule IDs, agent IDs, agent names, and other relevant fields. 

 

 

**CIS-CAT**

The CIS-CAT subpart focuses on monitoring compliance with the Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmarks. It allows you to assess the adherence of your systems to industry-standard security configurations. There are two widgets available under the CIS-CAT subpart: 

  

**CIS CAT Events**

Presents a bar graph that visualizes the count of CIS CAT events over a specified date/time range, providing an overview of compliance activities. 

  

**Detailed View**

Offers a detailed view of CIS CAT events, including attributes such as timestamps, agent IDs, and additional relevant information. 

 

**SCA**

The SCA subpart focuses on analysing software components and dependencies within your systems to identify vulnerabilities or potential risks associated with third-party libraries or software. The widgets and functionalities available under SCA are similar to those in the CIS-CAT subpart.
