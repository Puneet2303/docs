**Severity Level**

The Severity Level categorizes security events into three levels of severity: Low, Moderate, and High. Each severity level corresponds to a specific range of event priorities: 

Low Priority (Level 1-5): These events represent low-severity incidents or potential threats that require monitoring but may not pose an immediate risk to your systems. They typically include informational events, low-impact activities, or potential security weaknesses that need attention. 
 

Moderate Threats (Level 6-10): This range encompasses events with a moderate level of severity. These events may indicate suspicious or abnormal activities that warrant further investigation. While they may not pose an immediate critical risk, they should be closely monitored and addressed promptly. 
 

High-Level Attacks (Level 11-15): Events falling within this range indicate high-severity security incidents or attacks that require immediate attention. These events represent critical security breaches, malware infections, unauthorized access attempts, or other significant threats that demand swift response and mitigation. 

 

**Security Events Count**
 

The Security Events feature provides a count of incidents occurring within your environment over a specific date/time range. This information is visually presented through a bar graph, allowing you to quickly assess the volume of incidents during different time periods. 

By observing the graph, you can identify trends, spikes, or anomalies in security events, which may indicate periods of increased activity or potential threats. This helps in detecting patterns, understanding attack vectors, and highlighting areas that require closer examination. 

 

**Security Events Detailed View**
 

Ace Shield also offers a detailed view of the security events, providing more comprehensive information about each event. The detailed view includes specific event attributes, such as timestamp, agent ID, agent name, rule ID and relevant details or context. This view enables you to drill down into individual events, investigate the associated logs, and take necessary actions for incident response or further analysis and allows security analysts to gain deeper insights into each event, understand the potential impact, and facilitate incident handling or escalation if required.
