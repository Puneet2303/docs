The LogTest Tool is a valuable feature within the client account that allows users to test logs and simulate log-related scenarios. Clients can input logs into the tool for testing purposes and perform actions to analyze and evaluate their impact. Additionally, users have the option to clear the session to start fresh with new log tests. 

 

**Log Input and Testing**

  

1. Log Input: Users can provide logs for testing by entering them into the LogTest Tool. The logs can be simulated log events or real log data that users want to analyze within the system. The LogTest Tool accepts various log formats and structures to accommodate different use cases. 

  

2. Log Analysis: After inputting the logs, users can analyze and evaluate their impact within the LogTest Tool. The tool may provide insights, visualizations, or metrics based on the log data to help users understand and interpret the results. 

  

**Clear Session**

  

Clients have the option to clear the session within the LogTest Tool. This feature enables users to start a new testing session by removing any previously entered logs or analysis results. Clearing the session allows users to reset the tool and begin fresh log testing without any interference from prior log inputs or data.
